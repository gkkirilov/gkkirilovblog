# Something changed

`{{ new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {month: 'long', year: 'numeric'}).format(new Date($frontmatter.date)) }}`

I feel like my mindset was shifted, I no longer have the same values and supporting columns or I just made them invisible and I just need to put some reminders to get back.
Getting back to me means that I will try to train again and do meditation to return to the stoic mindset I have build over the years. Look for the future and see my future self working on important projects to me.

One big things is that a competitor has shown in my space and maybe I was associating myself with the project and now that someone else was doing the same I was kinda broken without understanding it.

Another things is that I feel like my brain kinda formed to its final state. I know how stupid this sounds. I think I am a bit overworked and will fix this at some point.

*We will see if this is the case for the long term as I will update this article at some point*
