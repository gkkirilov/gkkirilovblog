# I failed to follow my own advice of keeping out of my phone.

`{{ new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {month: 'long', year: 'numeric'}).format(new Date($frontmatter.date)) }}`

Today I deleted:
 - Reddit
 - YouTube
 - Twitter

They became an echo chamber of information I already knew and kept consuming as a procrastination tool.

Going back to:

>**Build, Build, Read!** *(Have some good concepts about this topic but need more experience, will build this one when the right time comes)*

Replacing a habit with another one has always worked better than trying to just not do it.

So today I placed my eReader where my phone was so when I get urge to procrastinate I just pick the book and read one to two pages before satisfying my mind with *procrastination*.

All my other habits are in check so this should put me on the track to success for the rest of the month.
