`{{ new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {month: 'long', year: 'numeric'}).format(new Date($frontmatter.date)) }}`

- Strive for independence in your personal life and connection in your love life
- Start lifting
- Watch what you eat
- Get enough sleep appropriate for your age
- Try a lot of new activities/experiences
- Make money no matter how old you are
- Pick a topic and start reading
- Make your life a game where you level up until you find your purpose
  - 6 things to level up:
  - health
  - relationships
  - mind
  - physical strength
  - experiences
  - physical form
- Become better at tracking your progress (I use Notion)
- Start making habits
- Wake up with an alarm
- Stop playing video games
- Extra to the new generation: stop picking up the phone every minute, you need to get some boredom time, to give your brain time to create new ideas
