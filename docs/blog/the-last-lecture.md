# The Last Lecture

`{{ new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {month: 'long', year: 'numeric'}).format(new Date($frontmatter.date)) }}`

A friend of mine shared to me the idea of "The Last Lecture" and the video presented by Dr. Randy Pausch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Dn33rTSBs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Dn33rTSBs)

How do you convince your younger self to take the high path in life earlier than you did it.

I will try to develop a study that pin points the strategies you should try and the approach you should take. Will see how it goes.

But first, 10 things I would tell my 14 year self. Sadly back then I didn't know better.

1. Start being active in physical and social activities
2. Better hygiene - what a mess was I back then
3. Dress better - look at yourself - full size mirror is very useful
4. Reduce time playing video games and just take another hobby that will have a long term effect on you. I just didn't want to see the reality and my life was on auto mode
5. Read books/ watch Youtube lectures/ find all the awesome materials you found later in life
6. Pick a project and finish it (it could be anything from social to programming)
7. Try to make money, no matter how little
8. Have fun/ don't become a boring old fuck/ watch comedy and learn to make and take a joke
9. Take life as a video game where you have all those parameters to improve on
10. Nobody cares about what you do so own your life

See you in the next chapter
