# The next revolution has started

I just watched the new Boston Dynamics [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iV_hB08Uns) and if you don't see it, you will in 5 to 10 years when at least 10% of the work force will become robots.

The economy revolution is starting and we should be looking for new incentives for the human race, work = money doesn't work anymore.

OK But what are our options?

Idk read the last sentence

But if you want to make money in the next 5-10 years become part of that revolution.

What do you think the next economy will be based on, or if there will be a new abstract word to call this system?
