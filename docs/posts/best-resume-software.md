# The winner is: [resumake.io](https://resumake.io)
### Runner ups ineedaresu.me and swiftcv.com

**I just have a few tips for writing your resume**

- ✅ Move the skills section before work experience - recruiters want to see that you have at least some matching skills from the job description in the first 5 seconds
- ✅ List what were the challanges of your past work experience
- ✅ Use active verbs like implemented, developed, architected, improved...
