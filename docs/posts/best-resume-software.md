# Best software for creating your resume
# The winner is: [resumake.io](https://resumake.io)
### Runner ups [ineedaresu.me](https://ineedaresu.me) and [swiftcv.com](https://swiftcv.com)

**I just have a few tips for writing your resume**

- ✅ Move the skills section before work experience - recruiters want to see that you have at least some matching skills from the job description in the first 5 seconds
- ✅ List what were the challanges of your past work experience
- ✅ Use active verbs like implemented, developed, architected, improved...
