# How to touch type
0. This proces is not that fast you will need at least 2 weeks to get good but it is worth it!!!
1. Go to [ratatype](https://www.ratatype.com/) or any other site that teaches the basics of touch typing.
2. Don't go for speed!!!
3. Go to [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) so you can learn the common words and after filling all letters with green go for speed, you will easily hit at least 50 words per minute

My max is around 92 words per minute but I am a lot better than the 2 finger clicking I did before where I could't hit even 35 words per minute
Go do it now!
