# Stop learning and focus on doing

I don't wanna write blog post which is going to waste you 10 min.

You have learned enough go try it before reading the next book on self improvement or dating or whatever it is, do:learn ration should be at least 1:1.

You can stop here, the next part is the logic behind the above.
Giving your knowledge to the people in a form of a product and having them use it, is enough of a challenge and delaying that by reading the next profound quote/article won't help as much.
